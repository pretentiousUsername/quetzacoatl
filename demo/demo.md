 This is my abstract for this document. It is a summary of
 everything in the document---though it does not *really* tell you much
 about what the whole paper is about. Good luck trying to get anything out
 of this, nerd! `\textsf{Sans!}`{=latex}

# Introduction

Blah blah blah blah this is some text. I like the text;

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2 h}{2 m} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = E \psi \rho $${#eq:yodelling_cat}

Text *text* **text** ***text***

$$ \sum_n \psi_n \rightarrow \int \rho(E) \psi \,dE $$

This is great typesetting---just the best.
