> A pandoc template for everyday typesetting.

The original pandoc template is, by most respects, *passable*, but not
exactly great; it's mediocre at best. So, I went ahead and made a template
for myself. It's nothing fancy---there isn't any beamer functionality or
anything built into it, and I'm yet to define a color palette for it---but
overall it's useable.

More work is needed, but, for now, it works.


## Dependencies

* TeXlive or MikeTeX (a full installation is expected, but not necessary)

* Pandoc


## TODO

* Make a custom titlepage.

* ~~Fix the overall geometry of the output pdf---it feels a bit fishy for
whatever reason.~~

* ~~Work on an XCharter otf mathfont. (*Kill me.*)~~

> In some good news, an [XCharter math typeface][xcMath] has *finally*
> been made---and I didn't even have to do anything. Huge thanks to
> Daniel Flipo for his work on the typeface. It's not perfect yet, but
> it's a dramatic improvement from what I previously had to work with.

* Fix spacing issues with the quotes and tables.

* Write comprehensive documentation covering each variable/feature of the
template.
