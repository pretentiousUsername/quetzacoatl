> A pandoc template for everyday typesetting.

The original pandoc template is, by most respects, *passable*, but not
exactly great; it's mediocre at best. So, I went ahead and made a template
for myself. It's nothing fancy---there isn't any beamer functionality or
anything built into it, and I'm yet to define a color palette for it---but
overall it's useable.

More work is needed, but, for now, it works.

## Dependencies

* Make a custom titlepage.

* TeXlive or MikeTeX (a full installation is expected, but not necessary)

* Pandoc

## TODO

* ~~Fix the overall geometry of the output pdf---it feels a bit fishy for
whatever reason.~~

* Work on an XCharter otf mathfont. (*Kill me.*)

* Fix spacing issues with the quotes and tables.

* Write comprehensive documentation covering each variable/feature of the
template.
